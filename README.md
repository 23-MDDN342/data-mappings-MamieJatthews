FINAL README:

CUBISM FACE FILTER:
Code by Jamie Matthews.

For this project I was tasked to create a stylised face filter using face detection technology. By using reference points on a reference face, I used various shapes in relation to these values to create a design which can follow a moving face. I decided to use a similar style to that of my previous project, embodying the cubism movement with simplistic and colourful shapes. When it came to making sliders which I wanted the AI to detect, Afew of my concepts were hair length and colour, hats/accessories, jewellery, lip and eye colour, etc. I ended up settling with hair length and colour and lipstick as I thought they were the most dominant features that would affect the appearence of my face. 

worked on understtanding the code today. After understanding how the points on the face can translate to making shapes I was able to begin making shapes on my face to create my mask. 

Today I worked on adding more shapes to my face to bring the cubism form together. I also experimented with editing the sliders. I plan to either a hat or hair ontop of the head which is affected by a slider depending on the references hair length and color. 

I Have been working on the sliders and how they will be affected by the reference faces. I've decided to go with hair color, hair length and whether they are wearing lipstick or not. Originally I was just going to have 2 options for hair. One with long and the other with short. Howerver looking at the sample reference faces I noticed alot of different lengths and bald people aswell. I ended up having 5 options of hair length which stack ontop of each other to make it longer. 

Trained the AI with my slider values. Through this process I have realised that there arent many features that I analyse which results in reasonably boring results. For example, most the men would look the same on my coded face as they all had short hair and no lipstick 

Trained more values in the trainer. Now all of the training faces have been trained. 

Uploaded sample images. For my images I tried to find images that have multiple people in them with different facial features. I wanted a variety of gender, hair colour and length to maximize the effects of my code.
